Touchscreen Mp3 Player made by Dcnigma.

Since DwJukebox din't support windows7 and touchscreen.
i decided to make my own mp3 player for me.
I build a steampunk theme radio and wanted to have a Jukebox.

Dwjukebox look good but i missed the touchscreen function.....
so here is my version for the world.
